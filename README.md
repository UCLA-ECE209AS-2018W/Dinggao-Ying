# ERIKA Integration

OIL file: is a part of real time OS source code, which is generated and compiled together with the application. There are two parts: a set of definitions and a set of declaration part of configuring a specific kernel. The first part mainly defines the data types, constants and kernel objects that need to be provided in the declaration part for configuring a specific kernel, which is similar to C struct declaration. And the declaration part is used to specify which objects are really present in a particular application.

Code.cpp: contains the task functions of each ECU, for example, read the sensor data and send the data through CAN bus protocol.


# Hardware Architecture

The following figure shows the view of hardware architecture. Firstly, we used Arduino boards with various sensors to emulate ECUs of the car. And physically connected each ECU through CAN bus protocol. More specifically, we have five Arduino boards (or ECUs) in our work, four of them connect with sensors, such as distance sensor, temperature sensor, water depth sensor, and accelerometer sensor. Once it got the data from sensor, it would send the data to CAN bus with a unique ID. The last Arduino boards (or ECUs) is used to receive all the message from the CAN bus.

# Software Architecture

The following figure presents the overview of software architecture. Our testbed system is based on Erika 3. The application of each Arduino (or ECU) is defined at the Code.cpp file, and the corresponding library is included in OIL file. More specifically, the sending ECUs transfer the analog data to digital data, convert the data to 8-byte char array, and send the message to the CAN bus with unique ID. And the receiving ECU will analyze the message and send it to the control system. Currently, we used Serial print line for control system. For example, when the CAN bus got the distance sensor data suddenly decreases, it will result in "gas down".

# Attack Simulation Setup

As for attack simulation, we built a framework of real-time sensor level attack, the overview of the attack is shown as the following figure. We used multi-thread Python to linsten each sensor data via Serial ports and used various types of attack functions to change the data before the data sending to CAN bus. In this way, the data sent to CAN bus is the wrong or in other words is the attacked data. For example, the ECU with distance sensor, the regular step is getting the duration of sound traveling, computing the distance based on the time, and sending the data to CAN bus. However, we inject our multi-thread python code to the application; before the data sending to CAN bus (right after computing the distance), we get the data, change the data with various attack functions, and send it back. The attacked data then was sent to the CAN bus, which mean the CAN bus receiver will not the original data. And the attacked data could lead false control system.

# Attack Demo Video

The following link shows the video of attacking on sensor level. In the video, we show the attacks on distance sensor and water depth sensor. We assume the distance sensor is for the automonous cruise control (ACC) system, which will follow the front car in a certain range, if the distance gets further, it will send the message to control system to speed up, and vice versa. As for the hacking system, we will change the original data to miss lead the control system. As the video shows, when the distance gets closer, the control system will speed up.
